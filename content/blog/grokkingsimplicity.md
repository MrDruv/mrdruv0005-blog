Grokking Simplicity by Eric Normand is a hands-on guide to understanding functional programming by breaking down code into three intuitive categories: actions, calculations, and data. It helps developers write cleaner, more predictable software—especially in languages like JavaScript—by applying functional principles to real-world problems. Whether you're new to FP or looking to deepen your design skills, this book makes complex ideas accessible and practical.
