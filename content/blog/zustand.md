## What Is Zustand?

Zustand (German for "state") is a lightweight state management library built on React hooks. It’s designed to be minimal, fast, and easy to use.

## Key Features

- Hooks-based API: You use it like a regular React hook.
- No context providers: You don’t need to wrap your app in <Provider> components.
- Minimal boilerplate: Just a few lines to create a store.
- Scalable: Works for small apps and large ones with thousands of components.
- Performance-optimized: Avoids unnecessary re-renders.

```javascript
import { create } from "zustand";

const useStore = create((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  increment: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
}));
```

You can use useStore() in any component to access or update the state. It’s that simple.
