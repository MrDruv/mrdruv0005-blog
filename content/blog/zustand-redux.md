## What Is Zustand?

Zustand (German for "state") is a lightweight state management library built on React hooks. It’s designed to be minimal, fast, and easy to use.

## Key Features

- Hooks-based API: You use it like a regular React hook.
- No context providers: You don’t need to wrap your app in <Provider> components.
- Minimal boilerplate: Just a few lines to create a store.
- Scalable: Works for small apps and large ones with thousands of components.
- Performance-optimized: Avoids unnecessary re-renders.

```javascript
import { create } from "zustand";

const useStore = create((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  increment: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
}));
```

You can use useStore() in any component to access or update the state. It’s that simple.

## What Is Redux?

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It centralizes your app’s state and makes it easier to manage, debug, and test.

### Core Concepts

- Store: Holds the entire state of your app.
- Actions: Describe what happened (e.g., { type: 'INCREMENT' }).
- Reducers: Pure functions that update the state based on actions.

### Redux Toolkit

Redux Toolkit is the modern way to use Redux—it reduces boilerplate and simplifies setup.

## Example

```javascript
import { createSlice, configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState: { count: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.count += 1;
    },
  },
});

const store = configureStore({ reducer: counterSlice.reducer });
```

## Quick Comparison

| Feature        | Zustand              | Redux Toolkit         |
| -------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Setup          | Very minimal         | Moderate              |
| Boilerplate    | Low                  | Reduced (via Toolkit) |
| DevTools       | Optional             | Built-in              |
| Performance    | High                 | High                  |
| Learning Curve | Easy                 | Moderate              |
| Use Case       | Small to medium apps | Medium to large apps  |

For **simple and fast** solution Zustand id fantastic.
For **Robust tooling and structure**, Redux(with redux toolkit) is a solid choice.
